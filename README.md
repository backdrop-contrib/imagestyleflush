# Image style flush

NOTE: Functionality from the Drupal 7 "Image style flush" module was merged into
the "[Image Effects](https://github.com/backdrop-contrib/image_effects)" module
for Backdrop (in the "Image styles admin" submodule).

"Image style flush" was originally written by
[Stepan Kuzmin](https://www.drupal.org/u/tostepankuzmingmailcom)
and maintained by [Hargobind Khalsa](https://www.drupal.org/u/hargobind).
